In this project, I use React for the frontend. Due to my limited experience with React, I only implement the most basic features, i.e. sign up/sign in and CRUD. Gnerally speaking, working with React is much easier and intuitive than working with traditional HTML. One reason is that it saves me from dealing with DOM manipulation. Passing data with React states and hooks is way cleaner than trying to handle it by myself.
In addition to the learning curve, which I believe will be gone as soon as I grow more used to working with React, one obstacle I encountered is that many tools that I used do not necessarily also work well with React, yet this problem should be solved as I get to learn more about the React ecosystem.
